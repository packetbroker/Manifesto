# Manifesto

Packet Broker is an independent and neutral organization operating a broker for Internet of Things packets. Open IoT allows messages from devices that are connected to certain networks to be sent to the destined network. Packet Broker provides a platform for IoT operators to exchange this data for greater network efficiency.

The following principles apply. Packet Broker is:

* Independent and not for profit - The sole purpose is to facilitate the routing of encrypted IoT data.
* IoT technology agnostic - Independent of RF technology the broker is able to route data. 
* Democratic governance - Members are able to vote on the direction of the organization and design of the Packet Broker
* No key exchange - The focus is on packet routing; business models, roaming or paid peering agreements to exchange keys are out of scope for the organization. Routing journals are provided to build bilateral business agreements.

## Sustainability

Business models concerning the key exchange are done out of band in a bilateral or cooperative way. Overhead costs for Packet Broker are covered by a subscription fee sponsored by all participants. Packet Broker will provide for key exchange reference implementations only.
